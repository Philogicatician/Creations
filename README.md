Whatever comes to mind

Sometimes I can't help but notice that I find myself interested in so many various fields of study that I feel as though I will never have enough time to devote to learning all of them to a depth of proficiency that I would prefer to them them in. However, I suppose this must be the case. It would seem that there are only a finite amount of resources for me to use. Time is indeed a precious commodity. Of course, whether or not such a thing actually exists is disputable, but we actively consent as if it is a real object. 

The abstraction of time and space intuitively seem to make sense, but one has the issue of verifiability in terms of time. For instance, how do I prove five minutes ago just happened? I mean, I recall the last five minutes, but how do I prove that such an instance occurred?

This, of course, leads to Hume's radical skepticism of doubting causation. That is, we don't actually see the causation between the cue balls as they hit one another on the table. Rather, we merely see a sequences of images and infer the relationship between the images. 

This is indeed a distressing idea, as Kant realized, because its implications undermine all of science. Kant sought to resolve this dilemma by pontificating on the topic for quite some time. His resolution was to show that empiricists like Hume, Berkeley, and Locke were contradicting themselves in the explantion of our behaviours because most basics acts of sentience and making judgments presupposes the claims of how we perform them.
